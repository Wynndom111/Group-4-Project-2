Presents summary data on the number of offenders under the supervision of
the adult correctional systems in the United States at yearend 2011.
Persons supervised by the adult correctional systems include those in the
community under the authority of probation or parole agencies that
supervise adults and those in the custody of state or federal prisons or
local jails. The report provides statistics on the size and change in the
total correctional population, by correctional status, during 2011. It
presents a comparison between the rate of offenders under correctional
supervision at yearend 2011 and 2000 and between the rates of offenders
supervised in the community and those incarcerated at yearend 2011. The
report also examines the impact of the changes in the community supervision
and incarcerated populations during 2011 on the change observed in the
total correctional population. Appendix tables provide additional
information on prison populations, including prisoners under military
jurisdiction and those in the custody of correctional authorities in the
U.S. territories and commonwealths.

Presents the prevalence of medical problems among state and federal
prisoners and jail inmates, highlighting differences in rates of chronic
conditions and infectious diseases by demographic characteristic. The
report describes health care services and treatment received by prisoners
and jail inmates with health problems, including doctor 's visits, use of
prescription medication, and other types of treatment. It also explains
reasons why inmates with health problems were not receiving care and
describes inmate satisfaction with health services received while
incarcerated. Data were from the 2011-12 National Inmate Survey.

The number of AIAN held in local U.S. jails nearly doubled from midyear
1999 (5,500) to midyear 2014 (10,400). At midyear 2014, 1.4 percent of all
(744,600) local jail inmates were AIAN, a percentage that was stable from
2006 and an increase of 0.9 percent in 1999. Males composed approximately
80 percent of adult AIAN jail inmates in 2011, and females composed 20
percent of adult AIAN inmates in 2011. This was lower than the percentage
of male (87 percent) and female (13 percent) inmates for all other races
and Hispanic origin. The majority of both AIAN inmates (71 percent) and all
other inmates (72 percent) were 39 years old or younger. A similar
percentage of AIAN inmates and inmates of all other races and Hispanic
origin were in jail for violent offenses in 2011. Nearly a quarter (24
percent) of AIAN jail inmates and 22 percent of all other inmates were held
for a violent offense. AIAN jail inmates (14 percent) were more than twice
as likely as all other inmates (6 percent) to be held for a DWI/DUI of
alcohol or drugs. Although AIAN inmates were more likely than inmates of
all other races and Hispanic origin to be sentenced for their crimes,
sentences for AIAN inmates tended to be shorter than those for all other
inmates. 1 figure

capacity occupied, and inmate-to-correctional officer ratios. It also
includes statistics, by jurisdiction size, on the number of inmates
confined to jail and persons admitted to jail during 2013. It features a

Presents national and state-level data on the number of inmate deaths that
occurred in local jails and state prisons, the distribution of deaths
across jails, and the aggregate count of deaths in federal prisons. The
report presents annual counts and 14-year trends between 2000 and 2013 in
deaths in custody. It provides mortality rates per 100,000 inmates in
custody in jail or prison; details the causes of death, including deaths
attributed to homicide, suicide, illness, intoxication, and accidental
injury; describes decedents' characteristics, including age, sex, race or
Hispanic origin, legal and hold status, and time served; and specifies the
state where the deaths occurred. Data are from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics'  Deaths in Custody Reporting Program, initiated in 2000 under
the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297).

Presents data on inmates confined in local jails between 2000 and 2016,
including population counts and incarceration rates, inmate demographic
characteristics and conviction status, average daily population, rated
capacity of local jails and percent of capacity occupied, and turnover
rates by jurisdiction size. Findings are based on data from BJS's Annual
Survey of Jails. Unlike prisons, jails are locally administered
correctional facilities that typically house inmates with a sentence of 1
year or less; inmates pending arraignment; and individuals awaiting trial,
conviction, or sentencing.
