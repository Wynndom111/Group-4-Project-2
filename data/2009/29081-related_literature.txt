Presents statistics about adult offenders under community supervision while
on probation or parole during 2010. It examines changes in community
supervision populations during 2010 and prior years. The report documents a
slowing of growth in these populations over time and declines in recent
years. The report also provides statistics on the number of offenders
entering and exiting probation and parole and the turnover of these
populations. It describes the outcomes of supervision, including the rate
at which probationers or parolees completed the terms of their supervision
or were incarcerated for violating the conditions of supervision. Appendix
tables in the report include detailed information by jurisdiction, such as
entries and exits by type; sex, race, and Hispanic origin of offenders;
offense type; supervision status; and Global Positioning System (GPS)
offender tracking, including sex offenders.

Fifty-eight percent of State prisoners and 63 percent of sentenced jail
inmates met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse during 2007-09, as
defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). In comparison, approximately 5 percent of the
total general population age 18 or older met the DSM-IV criteria for drug
dependence or abuse during this period. Overall, both State inmates (63
percent) and jail inmates (64 percent) regularly used marijuana/hashish
more than any other drugs prior to incarceration. This was followed by
cocaine/crack (24 percent of State inmates and 38 percent of jail inmates).
Fewer State inmates (42 percent) and Jail inmates (37 percent) reported
using drugs at the time of their offense. Sixty-nine percent of female
State inmates and 72 percent of jail inmates met the DSM-IV criteria for
drug dependence or abuse, compared to 57 percent of males in State prison
and 62 percent of jail inmates. Drug dependence for State inmates and jail
inmates is also reported by inmate age and race/ethnicity (Hispanics and
non-Hispanic White or Black inmates). Twenty-eight percent of State inmates
and 22 percent of sentenced jail inmates who met the criteria for drug
dependence or abuse participated in a drug treatment program since
admission to their current facility. 1 table

Presents summary data on the number of adults under some form of
correctional supervision in the United States at yearend 2009. Correctional
supervision includes adults supervised in the community on probation or
parole and those incarcerated in prison or local jails. The report provides
a comparison between the change in the correctional population observed
since 2000 and the changes observed during the 1980s and 1990s, which
illustrates the slowing of growth in the population during each decade. It
also includes the number of men and women under each correctional status
and trend analysis of men and women under correctional supervision since
1990.

Presents the number of adults under community supervision (probation or
parole) at yearend 2009 and the rate of change in both populations during
the year. The report examines factors associated with changes in the
probation and parole populations since 2000 and during the last year.
Includes a discussion about changes in the probation and parole populations
in selected states, the number of entries onto and exits from community
supervision, the rate at which probationers and parolees exit supervision,
outcomes of supervision, and changes in the type of offenses among both
populations. Appendix tables provide detailed data by jurisdiction,
including entries and exits by type, sex, race and Hispanic or Latino
origin; offense type; supervision status; Global Positioning System (GPS)
offender tracking (including sex offenders); and other information.

The number of AIAN held in local U.S. jails nearly doubled from midyear
1999 (5,500) to midyear 2014 (10,400). At midyear 2014, 1.4 percent of all
(744,600) local jail inmates were AIAN, a percentage that was stable from
2006 and an increase of 0.9 percent in 1999. Males composed approximately
80 percent of adult AIAN jail inmates in 2011, and females composed 20
percent of adult AIAN inmates in 2011. This was lower than the percentage
of male (87 percent) and female (13 percent) inmates for all other races
and Hispanic origin. The majority of both AIAN inmates (71 percent) and all
other inmates (72 percent) were 39 years old or younger. A similar
percentage of AIAN inmates and inmates of all other races and Hispanic
origin were in jail for violent offenses in 2011. Nearly a quarter (24
percent) of AIAN jail inmates and 22 percent of all other inmates were held
for a violent offense. AIAN jail inmates (14 percent) were more than twice
as likely as all other inmates (6 percent) to be held for a DWI/DUI of
alcohol or drugs. Although AIAN inmates were more likely than inmates of
all other races and Hispanic origin to be sentenced for their crimes,
sentences for AIAN inmates tended to be shorter than those for all other
inmates. 1 figure

Presents national and state-level data on the number of inmate deaths that
occurred in local jails and state prisons, the distribution of deaths
across jails, and the aggregate count of deaths in federal prisons. The
report presents annual counts and 14-year trends between 2000 and 2013 in
deaths in custody. It provides mortality rates per 100,000 inmates in
custody in jail or prison; details the causes of death, including deaths
attributed to homicide, suicide, illness, intoxication, and accidental
injury; describes decedents' characteristics, including age, sex, race or
Hispanic origin, legal and hold status, and time served; and specifies the
state where the deaths occurred. Data are from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics'  Deaths in Custody Reporting Program, initiated in 2000 under
the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297).

Presents data on inmates confined in local jails between 2000 and 2016,
including population counts and incarceration rates, inmate demographic
characteristics and conviction status, average daily population, rated
capacity of local jails and percent of capacity occupied, and turnover
rates by jurisdiction size. Findings are based on data from BJS's Annual
Survey of Jails. Unlike prisons, jails are locally administered
correctional facilities that typically house inmates with a sentence of 1
year or less; inmates pending arraignment; and individuals awaiting trial,
conviction, or sentencing.
