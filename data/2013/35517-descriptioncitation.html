								<p><span><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> ASJ 2013</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) is the only data collection effort that provides an annual source of data on local jails and jail inmates. Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails.  In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate
baseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails.  The 2013 Annual Survey of Jails is the 26th such survey in a series begun in 1982.  The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues.  The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. Starting in 2010, BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment, or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden, the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex.  Also new to the survey, data are collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity.  Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding, especially as they relate to safety and security in jails.
To address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails, BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails.  In the modifications to the ASJ, starting in 2010, 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served, staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death, and inmate misconduct. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2013.  These data are used to track growth in the number of
jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the
jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of
crowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail
population.  The data are intended for a variety of users, including
federal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail
administrators, researchers, planners, and the public.  The reference date
for the survey is June 30, 2013.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> In years between the complete census of local jails, BJS conducts the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). The ASJ is a sample survey of local jails used to estimate the number and characteristics of local inmates nationwide. For the 2013 ASJ, the United States Census Bureau, as the collection agent, drew a sample of 891 jail jurisdictions (including 21 newly added existing California jail jurisdictions) represented by 946 jail facilities (also referred to as reporting units). This sample represents over 2,800 jail jurisdictions nationwide. Local jail jurisdictions include counties (parishes in Louisiana) or municipal governments that administer one or more local jails.
The 2013 ASJ differed from the 2006-2012 ASJ's, as the 2013 ASJ included in the sample with a probability of one all California jail jurisdictions in response to the two enacted laws -- AB 109 and AB 117 by the California State Legislature and governor -- to reduce the number of inmates housed in state prisons starting October 1, 2011. The inclusion of all California jail jurisdictions resulted in an additional 21 jail jurisdictions (for a total sample size of 891 jurisdictions).
Since the enactment of the two laws in recent years, the California jail population has experienced changes in size that cannot be compared to the changes of any other state in the United States. For this reason, the California jail jurisdictions were put in separate strata so that they could represent only California jurisdictions.
In the adopted design, the over 2,800 jail jurisdictions nationwide were grouped into 10 strata. The 10 strata were defined by the crossing of two variables: the jail jurisdiction ADP in 2005, and whether in 2005 the jurisdiction held at least one juvenile. For 8 of the 10 strata, a random sample of jail jurisdictions was selected. For the remaining two strata, all jurisdictions were included in the sample. One stratum consisted of all jails (70) that were operated jointly by two
or more jurisdictions (referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). The other stratum (referred as certainty stratum) consisted of all jail jurisdictions (267) that --
-held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates and had an average daily
population (ADP) of 500 or more inmates during the 12 months ending June 30, 2005.
-held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more.
Certainty jails jurisdiction in the survey received forms CJ-5D (Certainty Jurisdictions-Central data reporter) or CJ-5DA (Multi-Jurisdiction facilities and privately operated facilities in jurisdictions included with certainty in the Annual Survey of Jails).  Randomly sampled jail jurisdictions received forms CJ-5 (County/City operated) or CJ-5A (Private Facilities operating for County/City jail jurisdictions). The same sampling design was adopted for the California jurisdictions.</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Standardized missing values.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
