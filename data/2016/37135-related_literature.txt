Presents data on inmates confined in local jails between 2000 and 2016,
including population counts and incarceration rates, inmate demographic
characteristics and conviction status, average daily population, rated
capacity of local jails and percent of capacity occupied, and turnover
rates by jurisdiction size. Findings are based on data from BJS's Annual
Survey of Jails. Unlike prisons, jails are locally administered
correctional facilities that typically house inmates with a sentence of 1
year or less; inmates pending arraignment; and individuals awaiting trial,
conviction, or sentencing.
