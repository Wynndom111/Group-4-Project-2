The number of AIAN held in local U.S. jails nearly doubled from midyear
1999 (5,500) to midyear 2014 (10,400). At midyear 2014, 1.4 percent of all
(744,600) local jail inmates were AIAN, a percentage that was stable from
2006 and an increase of 0.9 percent in 1999. Males composed approximately
80 percent of adult AIAN jail inmates in 2011, and females composed 20
percent of adult AIAN inmates in 2011. This was lower than the percentage
of male (87 percent) and female (13 percent) inmates for all other races
and Hispanic origin. The majority of both AIAN inmates (71 percent) and all
other inmates (72 percent) were 39 years old or younger. A similar
percentage of AIAN inmates and inmates of all other races and Hispanic
origin were in jail for violent offenses in 2011. Nearly a quarter (24
percent) of AIAN jail inmates and 22 percent of all other inmates were held
for a violent offense. AIAN jail inmates (14 percent) were more than twice
as likely as all other inmates (6 percent) to be held for a DWI/DUI of
alcohol or drugs. Although AIAN inmates were more likely than inmates of
all other races and Hispanic origin to be sentenced for their crimes,
sentences for AIAN inmates tended to be shorter than those for all other
inmates. 1 figure

Presents state-level estimates of the number of inmates confined in local
jails at year end 2013, by sex, race, and Hispanic origin. This report
provides information on changes in the incarceration rate, average daily
population, admissions, expected length of stay, rated capacity, percent of
capacity occupied, and inmate-to-correctional officer ratios. It also
includes statistics, by jurisdiction size, on the number of inmates
confined to jail and persons admitted to jail during 2013. It features a
special section on the 12 facilities that functioned as jails for the
Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Presents data on inmates confined in local jails between 2000 and 2016,
including population counts and incarceration rates, inmate demographic
characteristics and conviction status, average daily population, rated
capacity of local jails and percent of capacity occupied, and turnover
rates by jurisdiction size. Findings are based on data from BJS's Annual
Survey of Jails. Unlike prisons, jails are locally administered
correctional facilities that typically house inmates with a sentence of 1
year or less; inmates pending arraignment; and individuals awaiting trial,
conviction, or sentencing.
